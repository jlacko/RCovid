# Covid19-related stuff


In this project, there are several things I wish to know about the Covid19 disease (and coronavirus, respectively) and can't find answers in media/oficial sources.
Most of the data I've downloaded from [official site](https://onemocneni-aktualne.mzcr.cz/api/v1/covid-19). These datasets are provided by Czech governent as open datasets (since 28th March 2020).
